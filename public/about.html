                                    The simons uga Ltd, is a company founded in the year 2016, by Simon
                                    Musisi. Simon grew up in an Orphanage as a vulnerable child in
                                    Kampala -Uganda. During his childhood at the Orphanage, Simon
                                    developed the interest of becoming a businessman in the future as he
                                    was faced with a lot of financial challenges a young man, he predicted
                                    according to his teachers in school that it could have been business that
                                    would save him and his community the rath of poverty they were facing
                                    at that time. He determined to focus all his academic life on studying and
                                    understanding how to become a businessman.

                                    When he graduated from university in 2015, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in
                                    Procurement and logistics, he decided to move to Jakarta to spend a
                                    holiday with his guardian. That was when he became inspired to start a
                                    VANILLA business while in Indonesia. That took him six months
                                    developing the business in Indonesia and he then decided to move his
                                    new born business back to Kampala-Uganda as he saw it was wise to
                                    go back home and work with his friends from the Orphanage.

                                <p>
                                    On his Return to Uganda, Simon decided to build the business with his
                                    main aim to help his friends from the Orphanage to go to good schools
                                    and to create jobs for them and their community.
                                    The company has since grown to support several farmer groups and
                                    NON-PROFIT organisations in support of Vulnerable children.
                                    Over the past years to date, the company offers more than 50 Jobs to
                                    the community every season and it works with more than one thousand
                                    farmers across Uganda.
